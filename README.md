# Zuma-problem

Project done two years ago

Using DP method to solve the Zuma problem http://poj.org/problem?id=2915

There are many variations, and I thought this one is the most complicated yet solvable (with non-brutal force)

The most interesting counterexample I created is 113443311244221332231, which ans=4 but most programs would say 3

There should be more details here, but most are forgotten
